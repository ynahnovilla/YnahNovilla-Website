        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Ynah Niyel Novilla, and I was born and raised in Carson, California and attended Torrance High School. During High School, I played Varsity Golf throughout all four years, played in numerous State CIF tournaments, and was even elected team captain my senior year. Additionally, I was President of Key Club International (an international service organization whose goal is to encourage leadership through serving others), and was an active board member of culture clubs such as Kababayan Filipino Culture Club, Pacific Islander Club, the California Scholarship Federation, and Varsity Club. I also was awarded both academic and athletic awards by my school throughout the four years I attended Torrance. While participating in numerous extra-curriculars and volunteering at my local hospital, Harbor UCLA, I maintained a 4.3 weighted GPA, allowing me to be accepted into the University of California, Riverside. My highschool career has definitely helped my skill sets, and has allowed me to mature into the person that I am today.<br><br>

        I am now a first year Computer Science major at UCR, hoping to specialize in Business Intelligence Systems Administration. Even though it is only my third quarter, I made it onto the Deanâ€™s List for my academic accomplishments. Because I am still a first year, I recognize that I have so much more room for personal growth, and that I have great potential for many more accomplishments. Although I have yet to attain any professional experience, I have great experience with working and collaborating with other people, making me an outstanding team player. I offer my experience and strength in building high performing teams, and empowering others to engage and contribute their best efforts.<br><br>

        Because of my past life experiences I have become a determined individual. The qualities I possess include great teamwork, communication skills and attentiveness to detail. I believe that I can be a powerful force in the workplace, and I can use my positive attitude and tireless energy to encourage others to work hard and succeed in life. I am inspired by my father, who is also in the field of Computer Science. I enjoy using my skills and incorporating them into every project that I attempt, and I also enjoy learning new skills to help contribute further to my talents. I am an active learner, and am quick to adapt to situations. I am also eager to be the best version of myself that I can possibly be, and I believe that I possess the requisite skills and abilities to handle any tasks.
